# Project-Nemesis
Google but for TV catalog
We created a search engine for televisions and integrate it with voice assistants such as Alexa. People can simply call out for viewing a particular channel or even a particular show. Alexa will redirect the user to the channel where the show is currently running, or else, will give a notification in case that show will be broadcasted within some time, or even when there are no updates for that show in the entire day. 
A website through which people can set reminders to search and watch a particular show, anywhere on the go will also be created.

A reccomendation system based on user viewings and the most popular searches was also created.
